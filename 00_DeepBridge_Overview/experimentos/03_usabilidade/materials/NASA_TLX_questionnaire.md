## Dimensions

### 1. Mental Demand
**How mentally demanding was the task?**

Low (0) ────────────────────────── High (100)

- 0 = Very low mental demand
- 50 = Moderate mental demand
- 100 = Very high mental demand

**Rating**: _____ (0-100)

---

### 2. Physical Demand
**How physically demanding was the task?**

Low (0) ────────────────────────── High (100)

- 0 = Very low physical demand
- 50 = Moderate physical demand
- 100 = Very high physical demand

**Rating**: _____ (0-100)

---

### 3. Temporal Demand
**How hurried or rushed was the pace of the task?**

Low (0) ────────────────────────── High (100)

- 0 = Very low time pressure
- 50 = Moderate time pressure
- 100 = Very high time pressure

**Rating**: _____ (0-100)

---

### 4. Performance
**How successful were you in accomplishing what you were asked to do?**

Perfect (0) ────────────────────────── Failure (100)

- 0 = Perfect performance
- 50 = Moderate performance
- 100 = Complete failure

**Rating**: _____ (0-100)

### 5. Effort
**How hard did you have to work to accomplish your level of performance?**

Low (0) ────────────────────────── High (100)

## Scoring

Your overall workload score is calculated as:

**Overall TLX = (Mental + Physical + Temporal + Performance + Effort + Frustration) / 6**

**Interpretation**:
- < 20: Very Low Workload
- 20-40: Low Workload
- 40-60: Moderate Workload
- 60-80: High Workload
- > 80: Very High Workload
