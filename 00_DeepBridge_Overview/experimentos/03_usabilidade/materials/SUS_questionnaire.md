## Scoring

Your responses will be converted to a SUS score (0-100) using the following method:

- For odd-numbered questions (1, 3, 5, 7, 9): contribution = (response - 1)
- For even-numbered questions (2, 4, 6, 8, 10): contribution = (5 - response)
- SUS Score = Sum of contributions × 2.5

**Interpretation**:
- < 50: Poor
- 50-70: OK
- 70-85: Good
- 85-90: Excellent (Top 10%)
- > 90: Best Imaginable
